## Introduction
<br>
This project focuses on analyzing taxi trip data in Chicago using a public dataset from the BigQuery Link Data Set. It was created as part of a mini-project assignment in the Dibimbing Data Series 10.0 - Data Engineering class.

The dataset includes various information about taxi trips, such as pickup and drop-off times, trip distance, pickup and drop-off community areas, payment types, and trip costs.

The project also aims to develop technical skills in using data analysis tools like BigQuery and deepen the understanding of data engineering concepts taught in the class. Consequently, this project not only provides practical insights into taxi trip data but also enhances participants' technical competencies in data analysis and engineering.

## Question
<br>
Based on the project, the following questions were formulated: <br>

1. Calculate the average, median, and standard deviation of trip duration (trip_seconds) for trips conducted on Mondays and Saturdays. Compare the results for both days.<br>
2. Identify the five routes (from the starting community_area to the destination community_area) with the highest number of trips in 2023. <br>
3. Compare the average taxi trip costs (fare, tips, and taxes) based on payment methods in 2019. <br>
